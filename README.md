This program can be used to decode a simple substitution cipher! It outputs every possible solution for a given input.

### Getting Started

Before using, make sure that the Cracked.exe file and the largewordlist.txt are in the same directory. Then, from terminal/cmd/bash:

use ```Cracked -e "Your Message Here"``` to encrypt your message with a simple substitution cipher encoding

use ```Cracked -d "Your Encrypted Message Here"``` to decrypt your simple substitution cipher

### Side note:
Sometimes, if you try to decrypt a pretty simple message, or a message with lots of short, frequent words, then
it takes a while to run because there are so many different possible solutions. 


Enjoy!
