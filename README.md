# Simple-Substitution-Cipher-Solver
## UCLA CS 32 Winter 2018 Project 

This program can be used to decode a simple substitution cipher! It prints out every possible solution to given input.

### Getting Started
Before using, make sure that the Cracked.exe file and the largewordlist.txt are in the same directory. 

use 'Cracked -e "Your Message Here"' to encrypt your message with a simple substitution cipher encoding
use 'Cracked -d "Your Encrypted Message Here"' to decrypt your simple substitution cipher

I have my code and all of my implementation included if you care to see how the program works.

##### Side note:
Sometimes, if you try to decrypt a pretty simple message, or a message with lots of short, frequent words, then
it takes a while to run because there are so many different possible solutions. 


Enjoy!
